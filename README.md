# Rezu
<hr>
<h4> This application was something I have always wanted to exist, so I felt that I should be the one to build it. </h4> <br> Rezu is an application that allows users to post reviews of anything they want. The user can create a new review, edit their review, delete their review, look at other reviews, and search for specific products to read reviews. <br> This is something I've always wanted because I was tired of ordering 5-star products that ended up being awful once I got them.

The name Rezu comes from my idea of a "review zoo". This application will show honest reviews, from real people instead of reviews posted by bots, influencers, sponsored individuals, etc.
